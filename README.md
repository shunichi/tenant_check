# unsafe queries. (output warnings to log)
user = User.first # the query without tenant is unsafe.
user.tasks.to_a # the query based on unsafe record is unsafe.

# safe queries. (no warnings)
tenant = Tenant.first # tenant query is safe.
tenant_user = tenant.users.first # the query based on tenant is safe.
